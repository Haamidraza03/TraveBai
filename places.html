The monument was erected to commemorate the landing of King George V and Queen Mary at Apollo Bunder on their visit to India in 1911.
  
              Built in Indo-Saracenic style, the foundation stone for the Gateway of India was laid on 31 March 1911. The structure is an arch made of basalt, 26 metres (85 feet) high. The final design of George Wittet was sanctioned in 1914 and the construction of the monument was completed in 1924. The Gateway was later used as a symbolic ceremonial entrance to India for Viceroys and the new Governors of Bombay.  It served to allow entry and access to India.
              
              The Gateway of India is located on the waterfront at Apollo Bunder area at the end of Chhatrapati Shivaji Marg in South Mumbai and overlooks the Arabian Sea. The monument has also been referred to as the Taj Mahal of Mumbai, and is the city’s top tourist attraction.</p>

Bukhari was a Sufi saint and a wealthy merchant from Uzbekistan. Near the heart of the city proper, the dargah is one of the most recognisable landmarks of Mumbai. The Haji Ali Dargah was constructed in 1431 in memory of a wealthy Muslim merchant, Sayyed Pir Haji Ali Shah Bukhari, who gave up all his worldly possessions before making a pilgrimage to Mecca. Hailing from Bukhara, in present-day Uzbekistan, Bukhari travelled around the world in the early to mid 15th century, and eventually settled in present-day Mumbai.</p>

              Located on the Bhuleshwar Road, the temple was first opened in the year 1675 and has been relocated once to its current place. Inside the temple, you will find the statue of the deity which is made of black stone with an orange face. While the statue itself doesn’t have a mouth – to symbolize earth – and is simple and beautiful, the entire altar on which it stands is decorated by the devotees. <br>

This is the largest mosque in Mumbai and also one of the popular pilgrimage places to visit in Mumbai.
              
              The Masjid is a quadrangular building of brick and stone encircled by a ring of terraced roofed and double storied buildings. The main eastern gate leads to an ancient tank filled with about 10 feet of water. The tank is fed by springs at the bottom that contains gold and silver fish and few turtles. This is used for ritual ablutions; however modern facilities are also available for this purpose.
              
              This is the main mosque for the Sunni Muslims and was constructed & is managed by Konkani Muslims. Attached to the mosque was a Madrassa Muhammadiah, in which free secular and religious education was imparted to Muslim youths. The Madrassa had a hostel attached to it.</p>
